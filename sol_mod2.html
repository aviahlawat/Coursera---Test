                <h2>Sally Rooney</h2>
                <p>
                    Irish writer was just 26 when her debut Conversations With Friends took the publishing world by storm last year. It’s a barbed, witty page-turner about being young and fragile in the new Ireland, set in a perilously privileged milieu of performance poetry and small magazines. Narrator Frances is out of her depth, negotiating love, sex, friendship and ambition while trying to maintain a brittle sense of self. Rooney has a ruthlessly beady eye and an effortless comic style. Her second novel, a love story across the class divide called Normal People, will be published in September

                <h2>Guy Gunaratne</h2>
                <p>
                    Gunaratne worked as a video journalist reporting on post-conflict zones before writing his blazing polyphonic debut In Our Mad and Furious City, out next month. Set over 48 hours in a north London estate, where the killing of a “soldier-boy” by a “homegrown bredda” and the torching of a mosque spark a riot, it reveals London as a conflict zone for its five narrators. These include a would-be grime artist and a teenager resisting Islamic radicalisation, as well as older immigrants from Belfast and the West Indies.

                <h2>Jessie Greengrass</h2>
                <p>
                    Greengrass published her unusual and wide-ranging short story collection An Account of the Decline of the Great Auk, According to One Who Saw It last year; this February she followed it with her first novel Sight , now longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction. Her narrator is agonising over whether to commit to parenthood, looking back on the trauma of her own mother’s death and remembering childhood holidays with her analyst grandmother.
